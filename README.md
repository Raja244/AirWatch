# Air Quality Monitoring System

## Abstract 🌍
Air pollution is a pressing global issue, affecting health and the environment. This project addresses this challenge by developing an affordable gadget to monitor pollutants like CO, CO2, noise, temperature, and humidity. Leveraging machine learning, we enhance sensor accuracy and aim to provide advance warnings, especially for asthma-prone individuals.

## Introduction
Indoor pollution poses significant risks, impacting urban dwellers' health and well-being. Our focus is on creating an accessible air quality monitoring system using ESP32, effectively balancing energy consumption and real-time data accuracy.

## Related Work
Examining existing studies, we find both IoT-based and dynamic gas sensor approaches. While some suffer from high costs and immobility, others face challenges like frequent page refreshing. Our system aims to overcome these limitations.

## Modules/Components
🧠 -  **ESP32:** 🎋A powerful IoT tool for energy-efficient operation.
- 📊 **PM2.5 Sensor:** Detects fine particulate matter for accurate pollution assessment.
- 🔥 **MQ-7:** Monitors carbon monoxide levels for safety.
- 🌬️ **MQ135:** Detects multiple gases including CO2 and VOC.
- 📺 **LCD:** Displays real-time data for user convenience.
- 🔊 **Piezo Buzzer:** Provides audible alerts for potential hazards.

## Working on the Project
Utilizing a comprehensive block diagram, we gauge and chart pollutant levels, ensuring precision in data representation.

## Result and Discussion
Visual representations include gauges and charts for MQ7, MQ135, and dust density, providing clear insights into air quality levels.

## Future Scope
The project's future includes enhanced data analytics, integration with smart city initiatives, and constant sensor improvements. We aim to contribute to climate change initiatives and improve public health outcomes.
